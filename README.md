# 📖 Quraan Mini Project

**Quraan Mini Project** is an Information Retrieval (IR) system designed to process audio recordings of Qur'anic recitations. Given an audio input, the system accurately identifies and returns:

- **Surah Name** (Arabic and English)
- **Surah Number**
- **Ayah Number**

This project integrates speech recognition and text retrieval techniques to bridge audio inputs with structured Qur'anic metadata, enabling precise identification of verses from voice alone.
